This is a simple software written in python designed to encrypt and decrypt text
for secure communication. It is user friendly featuring a GUI window. 
This repository also includes various examples, prototype programs, and more.
If you want to use the program run OTP Complete.py. All other files are mostly
incomplete and dysfunctional (and a pain in the butt to use). Example OTP is 
an example of a one time pad, and Example message is an encrypted messge
that can be decrypted using Example OTP. 
Requirements:
 * Python 3
 * Tkinter Python package (default package, if you have python you should already have this
Please report any errors and bugs, and I will try to fix them. I am
working on getting the GUI to be completely independent from the Python log,
so I may not get back to you immediately.
ENJOY!

PS: the code is based off of the raspberry pi documentation for the one time 
pad, and the gui inspiration was from various sites including the rapberry 
pi docs for the shakespearean insult generator. The raspberry pi docs can
be found at https://www.raspberrypi.org/resources/
